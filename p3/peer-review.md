### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
Nope! I went throughs several clicks / repeated clicks / views / viewing-interfacing orders, and didn't not hit upon any errors. Au contraire, I find that the app is well prepared for a lot of cases - no likes, removed likes, re-liked (no-change) articles, etc. 
I would have like to see the 'filters' or categories work with more than justs 3 articles, but really that is not an error, purely a cosmetic addition that would have felt better. 

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
Please take this with a pinch of salt, since interface design is somewhat my 'thing':
Yes, I did not find that the interface itself was the most intuitive. Functional -- perfectly so. However here are ssome things that (as a design minded person) I would do different.
+ Where you have the social share -- I am inclined to click directly on 'share on...' as opposesd to reading the next row of social media platforms. I would change that. As a little extra, I might have used social icons as well. 
+ The blog images are huge -- so espeically when it is a top image I do not immediately realise I should scroll to read further. 
+ In categories, it took me ssome mouse hovering to figure out how the filters worked. I don't mind stacked filters but it felt more like a list than a selection. 
+ Since comments were inactive, I found seeing some of them confusing, because I wanted to react / comment / reply etc. But I did read in your project note that this was somewhat a stretch part of the project, so I imagine you only deactivated the functional parts of it, leaving static comments. 

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
The page views aren't commented, but are very simple and self evident. This didn't bother me. 
It would have been nice if the unused comments controllers were noted out, but once again, it was very easy to figure out given the clear variable naming, and I don't feel it bothered me. 

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
Absolutely! The entire social share sest up, which I myself have not used before, was very interessting to read and subesuently research. I have not yet used it, but I know it's on my 'to-explore' list! 

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
Not that I did this efficiently either, But I do see several axios calls, which could potentially be optimised. 

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
